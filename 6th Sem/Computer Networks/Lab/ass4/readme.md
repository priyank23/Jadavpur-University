## Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

This program tries to simulate the environment of data communication at the Media Access Control Layer for understanding the inner work flow of Code Division Multiple Access(CDMA) technique.

### Files present:
- `WalshCode.java` - This file contains the functions to create walsh codes for a given number of stations.
- `channel.java` - This is the driver program for this simulation.
- `input.txt` - The driver program generates a random number of message bits and writes it in this file for easier access to the user.

__PS - Assignment 1 is required to run this program as it uses bits encoding methods__


### Steps to run and implement:
- Put all the files in a folder named `ass4`
- Go to the parent folder. (This folder must also contain assignment 1)
- Open the terminal
- `javac ass4/channel.java`
- `java ass4.channel`
-
